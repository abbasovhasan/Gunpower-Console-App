## GunPower Simulation

This project is a simple simulation of different gun models with manual and automatic shooting modes. The simulation allows users to select a gun, choose a shooting mode, and see how long it takes to empty the magazine. Additionally, users can reload the magazine and continue shooting.

### Features

- **Gun Selection**: Choose between three different gun models:
  - 1-Famas Gold
  - 2-AUG A3 ES
  - 3-Groza

- **Shooting Modes**:
  - **Manual Mode**: Shoot each bullet by pressing any key.
  - **Automatic Mode**: Bullets are shot automatically with a random delay between each shot.

- **Reloading**: When the magazine is empty, users can reload by pressing the 'r' or 'R' key.

- **Timing**: The simulation measures and displays the total time taken to empty the magazine and the average time per bullet.

### Usage

1. **Gun Selection**: Upon starting the program, you will be prompted to select a gun by entering a number (1, 2, or 3).
2. **Mode Selection**: After selecting a gun, choose the shooting mode by entering 1 for manual mode or 2 for automatic mode.
3. **Shooting**: 
   - In manual mode, press any key to shoot each bullet.
   - In automatic mode, bullets are shot automatically with a random delay.
4. **Reloading**: When the magazine is empty, press 'r' or 'R' to reload.
5. **Continue or Exit**: After reloading, you can choose to continue shooting or exit the simulation.
